The main folder is composed by **checkpoints** and **OpenTest**, where the former stores trained model, distinguished by their suffix according to differnt experiment settings. 

Under the main folder, there are two types of files: __*.py__ and __*.ipynb__. In principle, the __*.py__ are scripts for model training and stores trained model under **checkpoint** 
directory. In each script, a __suffix__ variable is set for distinguishing different models in different experienments.

Exceptionelly, __channel_charting_tools.py__ and __offline_mining_tools.py__ are two scripts storing functions in channel charting and triplet/pair offline mining.

__*ipynb__ are notebooks for anaylzing the performance of models, and the results are stored under ```OpenTest/result```.

### **OpenTest**
Test on open datasets. The rirectory **OpenTest** contains the **data**, **result** and **libs** for channel charting. 
#### **data**
Specifically, **data** stores the online CSI data in __dichasus.csv__, and prepared triplets in **opendata_triplets_*.npy** and pairs in **opendata_pairs_*.npy**. For triplets, there are easy, hard mined triplets differentiated by suffix **HN**
#### **libs**
Under **libs**, there are files for creating multilable for autogluon (ensemble method), defining network structre (MLP/Conv1D/Triplet/Siamese), network loss (OnlineTripletLoss/TripletLoss/SiameseLoss/FewShotLoss), and training process.
#### **result**
**result**
